# cuddly-pharmaseek-bi
A business intelligence project created for academical purposes as a reconception of a pharmaceutical ERP-like application.
The project workflow included the overall data exploitation process from data collection, ETL process, datawarehouse creation to the development and deployment of the end to end solution. It also contains a suggestion and design of a light machine learning feature to implement in the application (check the jupyter notebook contained).
The final solution is built upon a little microservices architecture to support the heavy data processing in the business solution developed for the pharmacy and to seperate the processes (graphs loading & data loading) for a more maintainable solution.

Tools & Technologies used in this project:
* Microsoft Sql Server
* Microsoft Data tools, Analysis Services, and Reporting Services
* Microsoft Power BI
* Spring Framework (Boot, Security, Data JPA, and Data Neo4j)
* PostgreSQL Server
* Neo4j Graph Database
